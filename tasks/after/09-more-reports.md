# More Reports Features

## Changes

### 1. Daily Spending Graph
- Added a **Line Chart** to the Dashboard.
- It aggregates spending by day for the selected month.
- Shows trends in spending over time (e.g., spikes on certain days).

### 2. Improved "Spendings by Category" Graph
- Increased the height of the container to prevent overcrowding.
- Added distinct colors to each bar in the **Bar Chart** (matching the Pie chart colors).
- Adjusted margins and label sizes for better readability.
- The **Pie Chart** now uses a donut style (`innerRadius={60}`) for a more modern look and better label placement.

## Verification
1. Navigate to the **Dashboard**.
2. Ensure you have data for the current month (or select a month with data).
3. Observe the new "Daily Spending" line chart at the top.
4. Check the "Spendings by Category" bar chart. It should now have colorful bars and be easier to read.
5. Check the "Distribution" pie chart. It should be a donut chart with a legend at the bottom.
