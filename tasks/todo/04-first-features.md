# First features

You'll be working on the project given the following requirements.

Please keep strict to the requirements and don't make any changes besides the mentioned scopes.

## Briefing

The project aims to be a 'credit card' manager for now. 

The overall concept is that the user should be able to setup spending categories and upload credit card invoices so that an AI would categorize automatically each of the entries.

## Web

1. There should be a login page for the user to be able to login. Backend work might be needed.
2. Create a left sidebar to serve as navigation for the user.
3. Allow the user to create 'Categories'. This should be one option on the sidebar.
4. Allow the user to import credit card invoices. This should be another option on the sidebar.

## Backend

1. Ensure there's an endpoint for user login. Sign-up isn't needed for now.
2. Use an ORM for dealing with Postgres in Python. You can choose the best option.
  

## Finishing steps

1. Create a markdown file with relevant information from the steps you've done in @/tasks/after. Please set the output filename to the same as you are reading right now.
2. Since sign-up isn't needed for now, please provide me with python shell commands that would create an user for me.
