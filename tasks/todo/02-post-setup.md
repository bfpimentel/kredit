# Post-setup

You'll be working on the project given the following requirements.

Please keep strict to the requirements and don't make any changes besides the mentioned scopes.

## Backend

- [ ] You don't need to use Postgres as a docker container. I have postgres@17 installed in my computer. Please try to use that instead.

## Developer Experience

- [ ] Please use overmind for running everything on the project. You can look into @after/setup.md for details on how to run the project.

## Finishing steps

- [ ] Create a markdown file with the steps for running the project under @after/. Please set the output filename to the same as you are reading right now.
