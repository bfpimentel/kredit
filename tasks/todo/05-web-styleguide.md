# Web code style guide

You'll be working on the project given the following requirements.

Please keep strict to the requirements and don't make any changes besides the mentioned scopes.

## Web

Rule 1: You should always import typescript files using the '@/' alias instead of using relative imports.
Rule 2: You should always follow the prettier styling options.

1. Import and configure Trivago's `prettier-plugin-sort-imports`.
2. Import the `no-relative-parent-imports` plugin for Eslint.
3. Format the whole web project.


## Finishing steps

1. Create a markdown file with relevant information from the steps you've done in @/tasks/after. Please set the output filename to the same as you are reading right now.
