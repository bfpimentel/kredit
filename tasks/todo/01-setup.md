# Setup

You'll be setting up the project given the following requirements.

Please keep strict to the requirements and don't make any changes besides the mentioned scopes.

The project name will be 'kredit'.

It will be a monorepo.

## Backend

Setup Python backend with:
- [ ] uv
- [ ] Flask for API
- [ ] Postgres database and connection
- [ ] Authorization. Feel free to decide what's a good approach. I'm looking into simple auth, no SSO, although it should be expandable in the future.

## Web

Setup Vite project with:

- [ ] Bun
- [ ] Typescript (strict)
- [ ] TailwindCSS
- [ ] Eslint
- [ ] Prettier (print_width=120, double quotes, trailing commas, semi-colons)
- [ ] A stable component library. I don't have any in mind, so please make the choice for me with a good one.
- [ ] REST API client. Be diligent on the choice, choose something that has a great Developer Experience. Connect it with the backend.


## Finishing steps

- [ ] Create a markdown file with the steps for running the project under @after/. Please set the output filename to the same as you are reading right now.
